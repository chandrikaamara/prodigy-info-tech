## Description
This project is a fully functional stopwatch web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer, and also displays the times at which the stopwatch was paused. The design is enhanced with custom styling, a background image, and icons for a modern and user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Start/Pause Button:** A single button that toggles between starting and pausing the stopwatch.
- **Reset Button:** Resets the stopwatch to zero and clears the paused times.
- **Display Paused Times:** Lists all the times at which the stopwatch was paused.
- **Modern UI:** Includes a background image, rounded corners, and icons for a visually appealing design.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts layout and styling to look good on different screen sizes.

## Skills Used
- **HTML5:** Structuring the web page and its content.
- **CSS3:** Styling the application, including flexbox layout, gradients, and animations.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing the stopwatch functionality, event handling, and dynamic content updates.
- **Font Awesome:** Using icons to enhance the UI.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the application is usable on various devices and screen sizes.

## Description
This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The game detects win conditions and draws, displaying messages accordingly. The interface features custom styling and animations for an engaging user experience.

## Key Features
- **Gameplay:** Two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Win Detection:** The game checks for winning combinations after each move and declares a winner when appropriate.
- **Draw Detection:** If no player wins and the grid is full, the game declares a draw.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience across devices.

## Skills Used
- **HTML5:** Structuring the game board and user interface elements.
- **CSS3:** Styling the game components, including grid layout, animations, and button design.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing game logic, including win detection, draw detection, and player turns.
- **Event Handling:** Managing user interactions and updating the game state accordingly.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating the game board and displaying messages based on game events.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Using timeouts to simulate delays in computer moves.

## Experience
Building this Tic Tac Toe game provided valuable experience in implementing fundamental game mechanics using web technologies. It involved managing state, handling user input, and providing feedback through the interface. Additionally, optimizing the game for different screen sizes enhanced understanding of responsive design principles.

## Knowledge Gained
- **Game Logic:** Gained insight into designing and implementing basic game logic, including win detection algorithms and turn management.
- **User Interaction:** Learned how to handle user input and provide feedback to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Explored techniques for creating responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Strengthened skills in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update content and styles.
- **Problem-Solving:** Faced challenges in designing efficient win detection algorithms and debugging issues related to game state management.
